# StellarSwipe Contract Events

All events use a **two-topic format**:

```
topics[0]  contract_name : Symbol   (e.g. "fee_collector")
topics[1]  event_name    : Symbol   (e.g. "fee_collected")
body       <EventStruct>            (a #[contracttype] struct)
```

Event structs are defined in `contracts/shared/src/events.rs`.

## Event Versioning Policy

Every event struct carries a `schema_version: u32` field, starting at `1`.

- **Backward-compatible additions** (new optional fields, new events): keep the same `schema_version`.
- **Breaking changes** (field removal, type change, field rename): bump `schema_version` by 1 and document the change below.

Indexers MUST check `schema_version` before deserialising event bodies to handle multiple schema generations gracefully.

> **PR requirement:** Any PR that makes a breaking change to an event struct MUST bump `schema_version` and add an entry to the changelog table below.

### Version changelog

| Event | Version | Change |
|---|---|---|
| All events | 1 | Initial versioned schema — `schema_version` field added |

**Stability policy:** field names and types are stable across contract versions.
Adding new fields is allowed; removing or renaming fields requires a new event name.
