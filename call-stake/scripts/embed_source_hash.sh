# Compute a reproducible SHA-256 of the source snapshot used for a given
# build and export it as STELLAR_SOURCE_HASH so contractmeta! can embed it.
#
# Usage (called automatically by build.sh before cargo build):
#   source ./scripts/embed_source_hash.sh   # sets STELLAR_SOURCE_HASH in the
#                                            # caller's environment
#
# The hash covers:
#   - Every *.rs and *.toml file under call-stake/ (excluding target/)
#   - Sorted by path for reproducibility across platforms
#
# Third-party verification:
#   1. Fetch the source archive that matches the commit recorded in the
#      deployed contract metadata (key "GitCommit").
#   2. Run this script from the call-stake/ workspace root.
#   3. Compare STELLAR_SOURCE_HASH against the value read from the deployed
#      WASM with:  stellar contract inspect --wasm <file.wasm>
#
# CI enforcement: build.sh calls this script and will exit non-zero if the
# hash is empty, preventing a WASM from being shipped with missing metadata.
