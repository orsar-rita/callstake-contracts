### Gas Cost Breakdown

```
Individual Transaction (95,000 gas):
├── Transaction Overhead: 25,000 (26.3%)
├── Signature Verification: 15,000 (15.8%)
├── Storage Access: 20,000 (21.1%)
├── Operation Logic: 30,000 (31.6%)
└── Event Emission: 5,000 (5.3%)

Batch Transaction (58,000 gas per item):
├── Transaction Overhead: 500 (0.9%) ← Shared
├── Signature Verification: 300 (0.5%) ← Shared
├── Storage Access: 12,000 (20.7%) ← Optimized
├── Operation Logic: 30,000 (51.7%) ← Same
└── Event Emission: 15,200 (26.2%) ← Batched
```

### Throughput Scaling

```
Throughput Growth (Items/Second)
300 ┤                                    ●
    │                                ●
250 ┤                            ●
    │                        ●
200 ┤                    ●
    │                ●
150 ┤            ●
