## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Scoring Methodology

**Factors Considered**:

   - KYC level completed
   - Document authenticity
   - Identity match confidence

   - Criminal record
   - Sanctions list status
   - Regulatory history

3. **Geographic Risk** (15% weight)
   - Country of residence
   - Country of citizenship
   - High-risk jurisdictions

4. **Transaction Profile** (15% weight)
   - Expected transaction volume
   - Signal complexity
   - Follower base size

### Risk Score Calculation

```
Risk Score = (Identity Risk × 0.30) + 
             (Background Risk × 0.40) + 
             (Geographic Risk × 0.15) + 
             (Transaction Risk × 0.15)
```

**Score Interpretation**:
- 0-20: Very Low Risk → Approve all tiers
- 21-40: Low Risk → Approve Bronze-Gold
