## Decision Trees

### Severity Assessment

```
Is there potential for fund loss?
├─ Yes → Is it direct theft?
│         ├─ Yes → CRITICAL
│         └─ No → Is it significant?
│                  ├─ Yes → HIGH
│                  └─ No → MEDIUM
└─ No → Is there privilege escalation?
         ├─ Yes → HIGH
         └─ No → Is there information disclosure?
                  ├─ Yes → MEDIUM
                  └─ No → LOW
```

### Priority Assignment

```
What is the severity?
├─ CRITICAL → P0 (Immediate)
├─ HIGH → Is it easily exploitable?
│         ├─ Yes → P1 (24h response)
│         └─ No → P2 (48h response)
├─ MEDIUM → P2 (48h response)
└─ LOW → P3 (5 day response)
```

### Disclosure Timeline

```
Is fix deployed and verified?
├─ No → Continue remediation
└─ Yes → Has 45 days passed?
          ├─ Yes → Proceed with disclosure
          └─ No → Is there a compelling reason?
                   ├─ Yes → Discuss with researcher
                   └─ No → Wait for standard timeline
```
