## Disclosure Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. User Safety First**
- Users must be protected before public disclosure
- Fixes deployed and verified before details released
- Emergency procedures for active exploitation

**2. Responsible Transparency**
- Balance security with community transparency
- Provide sufficient time for remediation
- Coordinate with researchers and stakeholders

**3. Researcher Respect**
- Honor researcher's contribution timeline
- Provide regular updates during remediation
- Credit appropriately upon disclosure

**4. Industry Standards**
- Follow established disclosure norms (45-90 days)
- Align with CVE and security advisory practices
- Learn from industry best practices

### Disclosure Goals

- ✅ Protect users from exploitation
- ✅ Allow adequate remediation time
- ✅ Maintain researcher relationships
- ✅ Educate community on security
- ✅ Improve overall ecosystem security
- ✅ Build trust through transparency

## Timeline Variations

### Expedited Timeline (Critical Vulnerabilities)

**Duration**: 14-30 days

**When to Use**:
- Critical severity (CVSS 9.0+)
- Funds immediately at risk
- Simple fix available
- High confidence in fix

**Modified Timeline**:
```
Day 0-2:   Verification (48 hours)
Day 2-7:   Rapid remediation (5 days)
Day 7-10:  Emergency deployment (3 days)
Day 10-30: Accelerated disclosure (20 days)
```

**Special Considerations**:
- 24/7 team availability
- Expedited review processes
- Parallel testing and deployment
- Shorter disclosure window
- More frequent researcher updates

### Extended Timeline (Complex Vulnerabilities)

**Duration**: 90-180 days

**When to Use**:
- Requires architectural changes
- Multiple components affected
- Complex fix with side effects
- Extensive testing required
- Coordination with third parties

**Modified Timeline**:
```
Day 0-7:    Verification (7 days)
Day 7-60:   Extended remediation (53 days)
Day 60-90:  Comprehensive testing (30 days)
Day 90-120: Staged deployment (30 days)
Day 120-180: Extended disclosure prep (60 days)
```

**Special Considerations**:
- Regular researcher updates (weekly)
- Milestone-based communication
- Interim mitigation measures
- Phased deployment approach
- Extended disclosure coordination

### Emergency Timeline (Active Exploitation)

**Duration**: 1-7 days

**When to Use**:
- Active exploitation detected
- Immediate user harm occurring
- Public disclosure imminent
- Zero-day vulnerability

**Modified Timeline**:
```
Hour 0-4:   Emergency verification
Hour 4-24:  Rapid fix development
Day 1-2:    Emergency deployment
Day 2-3:    Immediate disclosure
Day 3-7:    Post-incident response
```

**Special Considerations**:
- Immediate team mobilization
- Skip normal review processes if needed
