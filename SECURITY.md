## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I test on mainnet?
**A:** No. All testing should be done on testnet or local environments. Mainnet testing is not authorized and may result in legal action.

### Q: How long should I wait before public disclosure?
**A:** Please wait for our coordinated disclosure date, typically 45-90 days after report. We will work with you to agree on a timeline.

### Q: What if I disagree with the severity assessment?
**A:** We welcome discussion. Please provide additional context or impact analysis, and we will reconsider.

### Q: Can I report anonymously?
**A:** Yes, but you must provide a way for us to contact you and verify your identity for bounty payment.

### Q: What if the vulnerability is already being exploited?
**A:** Report immediately via emergency contact. We will expedite response and may disclose earlier to protect users.

### Q: Do you accept reports from automated tools?
**A:** Yes, but please verify findings and provide context. Automated tool output alone is not sufficient.

### Q: Can I share my findings with others?
**A:** Not until after coordinated public disclosure. Sharing prematurely violates the disclosure policy.

### Q: What if I accidentally discover a vulnerability while using the platform?
**A:** Please report it! Accidental discovery is fine as long as you don't exploit it and report promptly.
